// When Not Using THe useCallback hOOK 
🔍 What’s the issue?
Every time you click "Increase Count", Parent re-renders.

That makes handleClick a new function.

Even though the Child is wrapped in React.memo, it still re-renders — because props changed (React sees the new function).

🗣️ React: “This onClick is a different function now. Let’s re-render the child.”

// After Adding The useCallback Hook 
✅ What changed?
handleClick is now memoized using useCallback.

So, it doesn’t change on every render.

MemoChild sees the same function, so it does not re-render every time.

🧠 Simple explanation:
Without useCallback: function changes → child re-renders.

With useCallback: function stays the same → child doesn’t re-render unless needed.
